<h4 align="center">BLAST Query Optimization using<br> Recursive Similarity Search for<br> SARS-CoV-2 Phylogenetic Tree Construction</h4>

--------
This repository contains program that was used as a tool for FASTA sequence extraction and phylogenetic tree construction using BioPython library and was intended as a part of my research and final examination at Information System Management at Gunadarma University.

The project structure consist of four folder/file:
```
├─ Datasets
├─ Output
├─ 01_input.ipynb
└─ 02_phylogenetic.ipynb
```
1. [Datasets](./Datasets/), contains datasets that was used in the research
2. [Outputs](./Outputs/), the folder containing files that were generated from the program
3. [01_input.ipynb](./01_input.ipynb), python notebook mainly for fasta reading/parsing, extracting, merging, etc
4. [02_phylogenetic.ipynb](./02_phylogenetic.ipynb), python code to construct phylogenetic tree
